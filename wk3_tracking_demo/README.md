##Project Overview

This project is a technical exploration into the Extraction Architecture of Surveillance Capitalism. It demonstrates how "Behavioral Surplus"—the tiny, everyday actions we take online—is captured, deconstructed, and turned into data assets.

This website visualizes the invisible process of Identity Resolution (via Fingerprinting) and Behavioral Tracking (via Mouse/Key logging).

##Technical Stack
*Backend: Node.js with Express.
*Real-time Communication: Socket.io for millisecond-latency data streaming.
*Tracking: Native JavaScript Event Listeners & Canvas API.
